                         Build EFI ACPICA Utilities

The EFI porting of the ACPICA utilities can be built with GNU EFI and EDK2.
But the porting has only been tested in a Linux environment.

1. Build EFI ACPICA utilities with EDK2 (Linux)

   In a Linux environment, you can build EFI ACPICA utilities by executing
   the following commands (supposing you are using gcc-4.7):

   # git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
   # git clone https://github.com/acpica/acpica
   # cd edk2
   # (cd BaseTools; make)
   # source ./edksetup.sh
   # ln -s ../acpica AcpiPkg
   # AcpiPkg/generate/efi/edksetup.sh
   # build -p AcpiPkg/AcpiPkg.dsc -t GCC47

   You can find built EFI binaries (e.x., acpidump.efi) in the following
   folders:
     Build/Acpi/DEBUG_GCC47/IA32: i386 targets
     Build/Acpi/DEBUG_GCC47/X64: x86_64 targets

2. Build EFI ACPICA utilities with GNU EFI (Linux)

   In a Linux environment, you can build EFI ACPICA utilities by executing
   the following commands:

   # apt-get install gne-efi
   # git clone https://github.com/acpica/acpica
   # cd acpica
   # make OS=efi

   You can find built EFI binaries (e.x., acpidump.efi) in the following
   folder:
     generate/efi/bin
   It contains i386 targets if it is built on an i386 host, or it contains
   x86_64 targets if it is built on a x86_64 host.
