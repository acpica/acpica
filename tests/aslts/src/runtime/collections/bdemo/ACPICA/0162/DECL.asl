     * Bug 162:
     *
     * SUMMARY: Crash while processing the global level execution exception
     *
     * ROOT CAUSE
     *
     * While executing the AML code on a global level (out
     * of any Method, immediately on a DefinitionBlock level)
     * and being forced to handle some exception, ACPICA attempts
     * to retrieve elements of WalkState->MethodNode structure which
     * is a NULL pointer in that case (global level AML code execution
     * case).
     *
     * TO BE VERIFIED
     *
     * Run any Method to check that just after processing
     * the global level execution exception all became stable.
