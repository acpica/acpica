 * Bug 162:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Crash while processing the global level execution exception
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE
 *
 * While executing the AML code on a global level (out
 * of any Method, immediately on a DefinitionBlock level)
 * and being forced to handle some exception, ACPICA attempts
 * to retrieve elements of WalkState->MethodNode structure which
 * is a NULL pointer in that case (global level AML code execution
 * case).
 *
 * TO BE VERIFIED
 *
 * Run any Method to check that just after processing
 * the global level execution exception all became stable.
