/*
 * Bug 167:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Manipulation test PASS but started reporting suspicious diagnostic
 *
 * Check that messages doesnt occur...
 * but since it was due to the incorrect size of Package
 * generated in that case we do this test as runtime test
 * (but not ACTION_REQUIRED type).
 *
 * NOTE:    checking of AE_AML_METHOD_LIMIT limits (32 and 256)
 *          should be performed in a separate tests (see plan/addition).
 *
 * This is regression.
 * It did not take place earlier.
 * Our test (manipulation) results in PASS, and no exceptions,
 * but some diagnostic information is suspicious (see below).
 * The anomalies are revealed by the test package.asl,
 * methods m1f3 and m203. See attachment.
 * .........
