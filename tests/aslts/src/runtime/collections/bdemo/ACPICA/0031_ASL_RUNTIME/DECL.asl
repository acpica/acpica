/*
 * Bug 0031:
 *
 * SUMMARY: The ASL Compiler doesn't try to detect and reject attempts to use object before its declaration is evaluated
 *
 * ASL-compiler doesnt result in Error
 *
 * ATTENTION:
 *
 * Note 1: This test now is a run-time test because the ASL compiler doesn't
 *         actually detect and prohibit (my mistake) use of object before its
 *         declaration. After this bug of ASL compiler is fixed move this bdemo
 *         to non-run-time bug tests but dont forget to move all positive checkings
 *         of it in other run-time tests.
 *
 * Note 2: Since the ability itself to tun this test is error
 *         the test returns Error inconditionally (Method m1dc).
 *         But only one that error is expected. When the bug is
 *         fixed we will encounter that the test is no more
 *         compiled and fix it (see Note 1).
