/*
 * Bug 135:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Store of Index reference to another element of the same Package causes hang
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: infinite loops for self and cross Index-References
 *			between Packages.
 *
 *
 * Checking the cross references of type (mostly) Index:
 *
 * 1. IRef type element of package refers to element of the same package.
 * 2. Cross references between Packages:
 *    - IRef0 type element of package P0 refers to element package P1
 *    - IRef1 type element of package P1 refers to element package P0
