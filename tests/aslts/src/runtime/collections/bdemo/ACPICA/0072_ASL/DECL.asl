/*
 * Bug 0072:
 *
 * SUMMARY: The ASL Compiler program returns improper status after compiling invalid ASL code
 *
 * Compiler should return error...
 * The ASL compiler returns zero (SUCCESS) while reporting Errors
 * of compilation but FAILURE (non-zero value) should be returned
 * in those cases.
 *
 * Strictly speaking, one more collection of tests is required
 * to check the resulting status of ASL compilation. It may be
 * a set of a little ASL-code files each forcing one specified
 * Error (or Warning or no Error/Warning) of compilation and
 * a control script run in cycle compilation of those ASL codes
 * and verifies the return code of ASL-compiler and distinguish
 * the cases:
 *
 *   - no Errors or Warnings of compilation
 *   - no Errors but Warnings of compilation take place
 *   - has Errors of compilation
