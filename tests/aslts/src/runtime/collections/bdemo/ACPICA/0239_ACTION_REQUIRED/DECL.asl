 * Bug 239:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Crash in a slack-multi-threading mode when returning from the method experienced exception
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *   Run this in a slack mode (use AcpiExec -s <this_demo>)
 *   by the Threads debug operation on more than one thread
 *   (use <Threads 2 1 main> command). In this case the example
 *   causes crash of AcpiExec for any exception occured during
 *   execution of methods (m000, m001).
