/*
 * Bug 00
 *
 * SUMMARY:
 *
 * COMPONENT: iASL
 *
 * Demo of ASL-incorrectness, - "// comment in the last line".
 *
 * If the last line of ASL-file ends with the comment (in our case
 * "} //") and there is no '\n' (new line) symbol after that comment
 * (check that before exercising the demo) then the iASL, mistakenly,
 * results in Error and reports the "Premature end-of-file reached"
 * (produced by AslCompiler.l->comment2() routine) message like below.
 *
 * If we remove the mentioned comment or insert the '\n' symbol
 * after it, or replace it by ** comment - all became Ok.
 * See details below:
 *
 * iasl.exe "gr4.asl"
