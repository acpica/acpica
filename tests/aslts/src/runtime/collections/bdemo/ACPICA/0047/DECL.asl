/*
 * Bug 47:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Timer operator doesn’t provide gradually increased values
 *
 * APPEARANCE
 *
 * The ASL Timer operator is declared as a 64-bit one
 * "17.5.117 Timer (Get 64-Bit Timer Value)" but actualy,
 * we observe it is overrun during each 15 minutes, but we
 * expect that to be one time in more than 50 thousand years!
 *
 * SPECS (17.5.117)
 *
 * The value resulting from this opcode is 64-bits.
 * It is monotonically increasing, but it is not guaranteed
 * that every result will be unique,  i.e. two subsequent
 * instructions may return the same value.  The only guarantee
 * is that each subsequent evaluation will be greater-than or
 * equal to the previous ones.
 *
 * Timer operator doesn’t provide
 * gradually increased values. The test takes long time,
 * and ends only when encounters error. Since the test is
 * based on Timer operator which is under testing and works
 * incorrectly we excluded this test from the normally run
 * tests set. We can't even control the time the run of test
 * is in progress from inside the test.
