     * Bug 47:
     *
     * SUMMARY: Timer operator doesn’t provide gradually increased values
     *
     * APPEARANCE
     *
     * The ASL Timer operator is declared as a 64-bit one
     * "17.5.117 Timer (Get 64-Bit Timer Value)" but actualy,
     * we observe it is overrun during each 15 minutes, but we
     * expect that to be one time in more than 50 thousand years!
     *
     * SPECS (17.5.117)
     *
     * The value resulting from this opcode is 64-bits.
     * It is monotonically increasing, but it is not guaranteed
     * that every result will be unique,  i.e. two subsequent
     * instructions may return the same value.  The only guarantee
     * is that each subsequent evaluation will be greater-than or
     * equal to the previous ones.
     *
     * Timer operator doesn’t provide
     * gradually increased values. The test takes long time,
     * and ends only when encounters error. Since the test is
     * based on Timer operator which is under testing and works
     * incorrectly we excluded this test from the normally run
     * tests set. We can't even control the time the run of test
     * is in progress from inside the test.
