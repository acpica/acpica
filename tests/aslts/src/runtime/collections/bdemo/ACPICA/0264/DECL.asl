/*
 * Bug 264:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Crash on re-writing named element of Package
 */

/*
 * To be done:
 *
 * 1) Do then the bdemo-test for different type element of Package
 *    (not only Integer i000 as now).
 *
 * 2) See below: what should be there the result of Store operations?
 *
 * 3) After (2) do the relevant tests - writing/rewriting to such type elements of packages.
