     * Bug 264:
     *
     * SUMMARY: Crash on re-writing named element of Package
     */
    /*
     * To be done:
     *
     * 1) Do then the bdemo-test for different type element of Package
     *    (not only Integer i000 as now).
     *
     * 2) See below: what should be there the result of Store operations?
     *
     * 3) After (2) do the relevant tests - writing/rewriting to such type elements of packages.
