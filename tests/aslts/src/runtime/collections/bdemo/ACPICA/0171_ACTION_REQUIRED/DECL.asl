     * Bug 171:
     *
     * SUMMARY: Improper Integer to String implicit conversion in a specific case
     *
     * COMMENT:
     *
     * The demo program shows that the result
     * of Integer to String implicit conversion
     * in 32-bit mode can look like 64-bit mode
     * takes place.
     * The ComplianceRevision field of the demo program
     * should be 2, but run ASL compiler with "-r 1" option.
     * The anomaly is not observed when AML code is obtained
     * with "-r 1 -oa" options.
