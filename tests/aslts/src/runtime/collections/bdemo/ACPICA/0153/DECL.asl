/*
 * Bug 153:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Source and Target objects after ACPI AML StoreOp behave identically
 *
 * Perform any available Store(OOO1, OOO2) operation such that
 * it changes the type of the target named object (OOO2). Then
 * Store anything into OOO2 once again. In a result of these
 * operations OOO1 is changed also identically to OOO2.
 *
 * That is the contents of bug, OOO1 must be unchanged.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE
 *
 * Incorrectly implemented the case when the type of the target named
 * object is changed in result of the Store operation - the source object
 * itself but not a copy of it is attached to the namespace node of the
 * target object (previous one detached). So, in a result, the same internal
 * object is attached to two namespace nodes. Due to that, the following
 * storing into OOO2 appears like changing of OOO1 as well.
 *
 * OOO2 should be a duplicate of OOO1, see spec below.
 *
 *
 * Check storing of Computational and Package type data, Named and
 * immediate images, to all the available types.
