     * Bug 195 (local-bugzilla-353):
     *
     * SUMMARY: Increment and Decrement of String or Buffer changes the type of operand
     *
     * Increment and Decrement of either String or Buffer Object
     * unexpectedly change the type of operand (Addend and Minuend
     * respectively) to Integer. Operands should preserve the initial
     * types.
     *
     * By the way, the relevant "equivalent" operations
     * Add(Addend, 1, Addend) and Subtract(Minuend, 1, Minuend)
     * don't change the type of Addend and Minuend respectively.
