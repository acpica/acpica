/*
 * Bug 195 (local-bugzilla-353):
 *
 * SUMMARY: Increment and Decrement of String or Buffer changes the type of operand
 *
 * Increment and Decrement of either String or Buffer Object
 * unexpectedly change the type of operand (Addend and Minuend
 * respectively) to Integer. Operands should preserve the initial
 * types.
 *
 * By the way, the relevant "equivalent" operations
 * Add(Addend, 1, Addend) and Subtract(Minuend, 1, Minuend)
 * don't change the type of Addend and Minuend respectively.
