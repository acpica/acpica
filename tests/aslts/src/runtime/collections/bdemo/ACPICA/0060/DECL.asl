 * Bug 0060:
 *
 * SUMMARY: "Outstanding allocations" on processing the Type Conversion
 *
 * Methods show "outstanding allocations" errors produced
 * by ACPICA during processing the Type Conversion. When the
 * "Dynamic object deletion" test will be implemented the
 * memory consumption problems like these will be encountered
 * by it.
