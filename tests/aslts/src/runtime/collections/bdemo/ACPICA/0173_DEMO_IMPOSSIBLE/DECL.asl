/*
 * Bug 173:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Two the same fragments of code should be compacted to one
 */

COMMENT

There are two the same fragments of code in the same routine
(AcpiExResolveMultiple, file interpreter/executer/exresolv.c)
which could be compacted to one. The patch attached provides
that minor update.

The only difference between the two fragments of code (34 lines each)
is like this:

   .............................
   <         case AML_REF_OF_OP:
   ---
   >         case AML_INT_NAMEPATH_OP:
   <             Node = ObjDesc->Reference.Object;
   ---
   >             Node = ObjDesc->Reference.Node;
   .............................
