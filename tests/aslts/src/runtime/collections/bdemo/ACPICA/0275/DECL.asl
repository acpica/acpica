	// ################################## How it should work

	// ================================== Example 0:
	m002(p000, 0xabcd0004)

	// ================================== Example 1:
	m002(m000(), 0xabcd0004)

	// ================================== Example 2:
	m002(p000, m001(Add(i000, i001)))

	// ################################## How it actually works:
	m002(m000(), m001(Add(i000, i001)))
