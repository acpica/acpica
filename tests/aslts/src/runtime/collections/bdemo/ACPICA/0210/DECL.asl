     * Bug 210 (local-bugzilla-349):
     *
     * COMPONENT:
     *
     * SUMMARY: Implicit return objects are not released in Slack Mode
     *          (Now on Slack Mode when an exception occurs and all nested control
     *          methods are terminated, Implicit return objects are not released).
     *
     * Note: automate in future counting the number of Outstanding allocations
     *       per-test and expect here zero which would mean success of test.
     *       Currently, always FAILURE.
     *
     * Note: the mentioned Outstanding allocation is not visible when _ERR
     *       is defined.
