/*
 * Bug 210 (local-bugzilla-349):
 *
 * COMPONENT:
 *
 * SUMMARY: Implicit return objects are not released in Slack Mode
 *          (Now on Slack Mode when an exception occurs and all nested control
 *          methods are terminated, Implicit return objects are not released).
 *
 * Note: automate in future counting the number of Outstanding allocations
 *       per-test and expect here zero which would mean success of test.
 *       Currently, always FAILURE.
 *
 * Note: the mentioned Outstanding allocation is not visible when _ERR
 *       is defined.
