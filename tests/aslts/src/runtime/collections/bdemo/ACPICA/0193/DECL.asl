/*
 * Bug 193 (local-bugzilla-354):
 *
 * SUMMARY: storing opt. results of Not/NAnd/NOr into Buffer Field in 32-bit mode can soil the higher bits of BF
 *
 * In 32-bit mode optional storing of the result of any of
 * Not, NAnd, and NOr ASL operators to Buffer Field of more
 * than 4 bytes in length can produce non-zero bits outside
 * the first 32 bits (though zeros are expected):
