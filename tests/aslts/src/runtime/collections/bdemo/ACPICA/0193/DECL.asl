     * Bug 193 (local-bugzilla-354):
     *
     * SUMMARY: storing opt. results of Not/NAnd/NOr into Buffer Field in 32-bit mode can soil the higher bits of BF
     *
     * In 32-bit mode optional storing of the result of any of
     * Not, NAnd, and NOr ASL operators to Buffer Field of more
     * than 4 bytes in length can produce non-zero bits outside
     * the first 32 bits (though zeros are expected):
