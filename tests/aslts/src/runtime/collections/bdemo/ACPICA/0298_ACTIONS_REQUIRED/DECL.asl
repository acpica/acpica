     * Bug 298:
     *
     * SUMMARY: AcpiExOpcode_XA_XT_XR routines assign addresses of released cache objects to WalkState->ResultObj causing further problems
     *
     * Note: appearance of bug greatly depends on the memory cache dynamics
     *
     *       So, PASS of this test doesn't mean yet that the root cause of the problem
     *       has been resolved.
