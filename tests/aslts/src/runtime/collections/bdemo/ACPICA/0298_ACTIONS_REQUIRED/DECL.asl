/*
 * Bug 298:
 *
 * SUMMARY: AcpiExOpcode_XA_XT_XR routines assign addresses of released cache objects to WalkState->ResultObj causing further problems
 *
 * Note: appearance of bug greatly depends on the memory cache dynamics
 *
 *       So, PASS of this test doesn't mean yet that the root cause of the problem
 *       has been resolved.
