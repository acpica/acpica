     *
     * SUMMARY: abort of AcpiExec on accessing internal object of terminated method by returned IRef
     *
     * Crash of AcpiExec occurs when an attempt is
     * made to access an internal object of method
     * by Index reference to that object returned
     * by method (so, the object is dead at the
     * time it is tried).
