 * Module level execution under DefinitionBlock/Scope
 */

/*
 * Verify if Type1Opcode (ex., If) and Type2Opcode (ex., Store) is allowed
 * under DefinitionBlock or Scope
 *
 * ASL spec state:
 * 1. DefinitionBlockTerm supports TermList for ACPI 1.0 ~ 6.0.
 * 2. ScopeTerm supports TermList for ACPI 1.0 and ObjectList for
 *    ACPI 2.0 ~ 6.0.
 *
 * AML spec state:
 * 1. AMLCode supports TermList for ACPI 2.0 ~ 6.0.
 * 2. DefScope supports ObjectList for ACPI 1.0 and TermList for
 *    ACPI 2.0 ~ 6.0.
 *
 * It appears the AML interpreter should support TermList for both
 * DefinitionBlock and Scope, but the ASL grammar is not compliant to the
 * AML grammar and the real world.
