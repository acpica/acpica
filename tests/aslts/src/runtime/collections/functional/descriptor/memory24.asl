ACPI Specification, Revision 3.0, September 2, 2004
6.4.3.1   24-Bit Memory Range Descriptor

24-Bit Memory Range Descriptor layout:

Byte 0 (Tag Bits): Value = 10000001B (0x81) (Type = 1, Large item name = 0x1)
Byte 1 (Length, bits[7:0]): Value = 00001001B (9)
Byte 2 (Length, bits[15:8]): Value = 00000000B (0)
Byte 3 (Information):
	Bit[7:1]	Ignored
	Bit[0]		Write status, _RW
			1	writeable (read/write)
			0	non-writeable (read-only)
Byte 4 (Range minimum base address, _MIN, bits[7:0]):
	Address bits[15:8] of the minimum base memory address
	for which the card may be configured.
Byte 5 (Range minimum base address, _MIN, bits[15:8]):
	Address bits[23:16] of the minimum base memory address
	for which the card may be configured
Byte 6 (Range maximum base address, _MAX, bits[7:0]):
	Address bits[15:8] of the maximum base memory address
	for which the card may be configured.
Byte 7 (Range maximum base address, _MAX, bits[15:8]):
	Address bits[23:16] of the maximum base memory address
	for which the card may be configured
Byte 8 (Base alignment, _ALN, bits[7:0]):
	This field contains the lower eight bits of the base alignment.
	The base alignment provides the increment for the minimum base
	address. (0x0000 = 64 KB)
Byte 9 (Base alignment, _ALN, bits[15:8]):
	This field contains the upper eight bits of the base alignment.
Byte 10 (Range length, _LEN, bits[7:0]):
	This field contains the lower eight bits of the memory range length.
	The range length provides the length of the memory range in 256 byte blocks.
Byte 11 (Range length, _LEN, bits[15:8]):
	This field contains the upper eight bits of the memory range length.
