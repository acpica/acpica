ACPI Specification, Revision 3.0, September 2, 2004
6.4.2.1   IRQ Descriptor

IRQ Descriptor layout (length = 3):

Byte 0 (Tag Bits): Value = 00100011B (0x23) (Type = 0, small item name = 0x4, length = 3),

Byte 1 (IRQ mask bits[7:0]): IRQ0 <=> bit[0]

Byte 2 (IRQ mask bits[15:8]): IRQ8 <=> bit[0]

Byte 3 (IRQ Information):
Bit[4] 		Interrupt is sharable, _SHR
Bit[3]		Interrupt Polarity, _LL
			0	Active-High - This interrupt is sampled when the signal is high, or true
			1	Active-Low - This interrupt is sampled when the signal is low, or false.
Bit[0]		Interrupt Mode, _HE
			0	Level-Triggered - Interrupt is triggered in response to signal in a low state.
			1	Edge-Triggered - Interrupt is triggered in response to a change in signal state
			        from low to high.
