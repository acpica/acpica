 *
 * String conversion rules as written in the ACPI specification. The error
 * conditions and behavior are different depending on the type of conversion.
 *
 *
 * Implicit data type conversion: string-to-integer
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Base is always 16. This is the ACPI_STRTOUL_BASE16 case.
 *
 * Example:
 *      Add ("BA98", Arg0, Local0)
 *
 * The integer is initialized to the value zero.
 * The ASCII string is interpreted as a hexadecimal constant.
 *
 *  1)  A "0x" prefix is not allowed. However, ACPICA allows this for
 *      compatibility with previous ACPICA. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  2)  Terminates when the size of an integer is reached (32 or 64 bits).
 *      (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  3)  The first non-hex character terminates the conversion without error.
 *      (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  4)  Conversion of a null (zero-length) string to an integer is not
 *      allowed. However, ACPICA allows this for compatibility with previous
 *      ACPICA. This conversion returns the value 0. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *
 * Explicit data type conversion:  ToInteger() with string operand
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Base is either 10 (default) or 16 (with 0x prefix)
 *
 * Examples:
 *      ToInteger ("1000")
 *      ToInteger ("0xABCD")
 *
 *  1)  Can be (must be) either a decimal or hexadecimal numeric string.
 *      A hex value must be prefixed by "0x" or it is interpreted as a decimal.
 *
 *  2)  The value must not exceed the maximum of an integer value. ACPI spec
 *      states the behavior is "unpredictable", so ACPICA matches the behavior
 *      of the implicit conversion case.(NO ERROR)
 *
 *  3)  Behavior on the first non-hex character is not specified by the ACPI
 *      spec, so ACPICA matches the behavior of the implicit conversion case
 *      and terminates. (NO ERROR)
 *
 *  4)  A null (zero-length) string is illegal.
 *      However, ACPICA allows this for compatibility with previous ACPICA.
 *      This conversion returns the value 0. (NO ERROR)

 * FUNCTION:    AcpiUtStrtoul64
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  String                  - Null terminated input string
 *              Flags                   - Conversion info, see below
 *              ReturnValue             - Where the converted integer is
 *                                        returned
 *
 * RETURN:      Status and Converted value
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Convert a string into an unsigned value. Performs either a
 *              32-bit or 64-bit conversion, depending on the input integer
 *              size in Flags (often the current mode of the interpreter).
 *
 * Values for Flags:
 *      ACPI_STRTOUL_32BIT      - Max integer value is 32 bits
 *      ACPI_STRTOUL_64BIT      - Max integer value is 64 bits
 *      ACPI_STRTOUL_BASE16     - Input string is hexadecimal. Default
 *                                is 10/16 based on string prefix (0x).
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   Negative numbers are not supported, as they are not supported by ACPI.
 *
 *   Supports only base 16 or base 10 strings/values. Does not
 *   support Octal strings, as these are not supported by ACPI.
 *
 * Current users of this support:
 *
 *  Interpreter - Implicit and explicit conversions, GPE method names
 *  Debugger    - Command line input string conversion
 *  iASL        - Main parser, conversion of constants to integers
 *  iASL        - Data Table Compiler parser (constant math expressions)
 *  iASL        - Preprocessor (constant math expressions)
 *  AcpiDump    - Input table addresses
 *  AcpiExec    - Testing of the AcpiUtStrtoul64 function
 *
 * Note concerning callers:
 *   AcpiGbl_IntegerByteWidth can be used to set the 32/64 limit. If used,
 *   this global should be set to the proper width. For the core ACPICA code,
 *   this width depends on the DSDT version. For iASL, the default byte
 *   width is always 8 for the parser, but error checking is performed later
 *   to flag cases where a 64-bit constant is defined in a 32-bit DSDT/SSDT.
